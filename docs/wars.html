  <h2>The War for the Better Browser</h2>
  <img src="images/browser.jpg" align="right" style="width: 320px; height: 213px">
  <p>
    After a surge of internet usage, many companies began to fight for the large power that it held, as it was becoming very widely used. Many wanted control of the internet and its usage because of its ubiquity.
  </p><br>
  <h3>Mosaic</h3>
  <p>Mosaic was one of the earliest web browsers to be used b the public as it was very user friendly to those that were new to computers, which was the demographic for the majority of internet users. It was created by a group of students and was one of the first clients for FTP. The browser itself was important in making the World Wide Web more popular.
    Many companies were ready to profit from these web browsers which would create competition from web browser developers. Mosaic became one of those companies, ready to profit off of the soon to be extremely popular internet.
  </p><br>

  <h3>Microsoft</h3>
  <p>Microsoft had already had a type of monopoly in the computer industry, as it sold the most computers with its operating systems. Bill Gates felt that information should be at a fee for others. Before Mosaic, Bill Gates was one of the most powerful businessmen in the world, and microsoft was one of the biggest companies. After some hesitation from gates, Microsoft began developing their one web browser as a separate entity.
  </p>
  <h3>Netscape Navigator
  </h3>
  <p>
    Netscape became a great competition of mosaic and took the lead as the internet continued to grow larger. It would become the most widely used web browser in the 1990s by billions. The company continued to grow.
  </p>
  <h3>Netscape vs. Microsoft</h3>
  <p>
    In a meeting between Netscape and Microsoft, Microsoft detailed that they would either absorb the Netscape company, or gain almost all of the usage shares without them. Netscape and Microsoft ensued in a legal battle after Netscape accused Microsoft for trying to create a monopoly in usage shares for Microsoft's new browser. Soon, Microsoft was sued by the Department of Justice because of this. This was one of the first browser wars that would ensue due to power.
