    <h2>What Started It All: Invention of the Internet</h2>
    <img src="images/coloredcables.png" align="right" style="width: 320px; height: 213px">
    <p>The internet has evolved from a small form of military intel usage, to having millions of users around
        the world. It has grown very rapidly and has had an enormous impact on the
        lives of everyone that uses it, through its easy form of communication and access to information.
    </p><br>
    <h3>Uses of the Internet</h3>
    <p>The internet can be used in several ways. Many use it as a form of communication, whether it be through
        businesses in a workplace setting, or socially with friends and family. It can also be used in finances,
        which was a big cause of rapid financial growth in its development. Others use it as a personal store,
        shopping online for things on sites such as amazon, reducing the need to leave the house.
    </p><br>

    <img src="images/htmlpic2.png" align="right" style="width: 320px; height:213px">
    <h3>Early Development</h3>
    <p>The Computer was initially used in the military, through use of gathering intel and transferring information.
        Computer research grew after the creation of NASA.<br>
        The technology to use the internet was seen in telephone systems, in which wires would allow connection
        between phones in different locations.<br>
        Fishnet Networks: If one form of communication was destroyed, there were still other ways for the two
        systems to be able to communicate.<br>
        Hot Potato Routing: A message arriving to a network, despite part of the message being destroyed in the
        transfer. This is done by converting the data into small pieces of information.<br>
        1969: Creating a system in which two computers would be able to communicate on the same network in order
        for more efficient communication.
    </p>

    <h3>ARPANET</h3>
    <img src="images/speedtest.jpg" align="right" style="width: 320px; height:213px">
    <p>
        Computer to computer communication in which one computer would send a program to another. It would be the
        first of its kind to have distributed control, becoming a foundation for what the internet would become. It was the first to use TCP/IP Protocols. <br>
        It had only 25 computers in its network but this number would skyrocket after a convention held by Arpa.
        In 1983 TCP IP was established as the universal standard for computer networks of interconnected computers.
        ARPANET became a tool used for intel and research, rather than for commercial purposes.
    </p>
    <h3>Commercial Use</h3>
    <p>
        On June 9, 1992, congress passed a bill making the internet public, rather than for military use, meaning that it
        would be open to the people for commercial use. It skyrocketed many programs that one can use on their computers
        on the daily.<br>
        Despite this, it was still difficult to use a computer with being deeply knowledgeable in it. Burners Lee wanted
        to develop a way for the internet to be used by more people and in a much easier way. It led to the development
        of the mouse that would allow one to easily navigate.<br>
        The World Wide Web was developed in order to have easier access to information. There were still very few web
        pages on the internet, and it was not the most user friendly.<br>
        NetScape allows for easier access to the world wide web and allowed to be more user friendly, which created a
        wider use of the internet and computers, with its users growing by a significant amount.<br>
